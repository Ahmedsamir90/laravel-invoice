this is an invoice system based on laravel 5.4 using sqlite. fully responsive cos im not using "table" for the invoice part i.e adding or removing invoice item. the invoice page was running perfectly according to me.. :D
created to help me for the commission to my staff.

ive got a few idea on this partial project such as :
1. daily income and expenses for the individual, family or/and organisations (a very simple one that is and easy to operate and understand)
2. more to come.. :D

it will be perfect if it can used graph for this purpose.

contact me if u r interested to make something awesome!
